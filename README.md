# Schedule Email Bot
Pretty shabby email/discord bot I built to save the inconvenience for looking at google drive for schedules.

## Background

The school I go to groups classes into flexible 'blocks' of time. These 'blocks' of time are prone to change everyday and they are published on a google sheets. Instead of actually visiting the sheets page everyday, why not just send it/email it to you?

I'll admit that the code here is not 100% reusable since a lot of things were special cases when I was scraping the schedules.

## TO-DO
- [ ] Add a different good morning message everyday
- [ ] Parse extra data in the schedule so formatting looks nice
- [ ] Add some screenshots
- [ ] Credit dependencies
