# Schedule Email Bot :envelope:
[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Pretty shabby email/discord bot written in JS. I built this to save the inconvenience for looking at google drive for schedules.

Special thanks to [Aidan](https://github.com/aidangoettsch).

## Background :flags:

The school I go to groups classes into flexible 'blocks' of time. These 'blocks' of time are prone to change everyday and they are published on a google sheets. Instead of actually visiting the sheets page everyday, why not just send it/email it to you?

Even if not meant to be reused, I'll admit that the code here is not 100% reusable since a lot of things were special cases when I was scraping the schedules.
